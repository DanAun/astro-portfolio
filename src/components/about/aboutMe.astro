      My name is <span class="text-white text-shadow">Daniel Aunan</span>

      I'm a cybersecurity engineer with a strong foundation in 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">network operations</span> and 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">infrastructure security</span>. 
      Currently working as an OT Network Technician at Intility in Oslo, I focus on 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">operational technology platforms</span>, 
      network monitoring, and ensuring the resilience of critical infrastructure. 
      My solid networking knowledge is backed by 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">CCNA certification</span> and hands-on experience 
      in both IT and OT environments.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      My international journey has taken me across Europe and Asia. I earned a 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">double master's degree</span> — 
      in Computer & Network Engineering from <span class="text-primary font-semibold">INSA Toulouse, France</span> 
      and in Security of Computer Systems from <span class="text-primary font-semibold">ENSEEIHT (TLS-SEC)</span>. 
      During my studies, I completed an exchange semester at 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">Seoul National University of Science and Technology in South Korea</span>, 
      broadening my technical and cultural perspectives. I then worked in 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">Brussels, Belgium</span> at EUROCONTROL's EATM-CERT, 
      conducting penetration testing and developing CTF challenges for the European aviation community.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      This diverse international experience has shaped my ability to 
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">adapt quickly</span> to new environments, technologies, and teams. 
      Whether it's learning new security frameworks, mastering emerging network technologies, or collaborating 
      across cultures, I thrive on <span class="text-primary font-semibold">continuous learning</span> and 
      staying ahead of the evolving landscape in <span class="text-primary font-semibold">cybersecurity</span> 
      and <span class="text-primary font-semibold">network operations</span>.
